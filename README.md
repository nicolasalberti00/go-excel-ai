# Go-excel-AI

This project aims to be able to edit cells in Excel sheets after an AI prompt. I'm committing to this project whenever I can,
as I intend to use it also as a way to improve my skills.

## Usage

In order to run the program, you need to have Go installed, cloned the repository and then, inside the `cmd` folder you need to run:

```
go run main.go --model MODEL_NAME --file FILEPATH --sheetName SHEET_NAME --cell CELL_NAME --prompt 'PROMPT'
```
