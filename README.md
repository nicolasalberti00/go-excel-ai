# Go-excel-AI

This is a project made to manipulate an Excel file and replace the cell contents after an AI prompt.
I'm working on this project whenever I have free time, and for fun.

## Usage

To run the program you need to have Go installed and then, after cloning the repo, inside the `cmd` folder you just run:

```
go run main.go --model MODEL_NAME --file EXCEL_FILEPATH --sheetName SHEET_NAME --cell CELL_TO_BE_MODIFIED --prompt 'PROMPT'
```
